DATASET INFORMATION

The contents of this dataset describe the acrylic garter fabric sample undergoing uniaxial stretching. The sample was prepped to undergo Digital Image Correlation (DIC) analysis. Data was collected in December 2022.
It is to be used with the (as of file generation date, unpublished) manuscript:
"Programming Mechanics in Knitted Materials, Stitch by Stitch"

CONTENTS

The folder "edited_images" contain 37 TIF images of the garter fabric undergoing stretching along its y-axis. They were converted to black and white using the program FIJI. 

The folders "xDataE1" and "yDataE1" contain CSV files tracking the deformation of a garter fabric undergoing uniaxial stretching. Each file corresponds to a different frame of the fabric being stretched. 

MATERIAL INFORMATION

The acrylic yarn is Brava worsted yarn (28455-White) from KnitPicks(â„¢), which is 100% acrylic. The fabric was coated in graphite powder to aid with the tracking. 

ANALYSIS

We used Ncorr, an open source MATLAB software, to perform the DIC analysis.
